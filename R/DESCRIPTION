Description:
    Tools for spectral clustering of weighted directed networks using motif
    adjacency matrices. Methods perform well on large and sparse networks, and
    random sampling methods for generating weighted directed networks are also
    provided. Based on methodology detailed in Underwood, Elliott and Cucuringu
    (2020) <arXiv:2004.01293>.
